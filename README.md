# Tonal-Research
Some work done on improving the HPCP chroma vector developed at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. 
The folder contains the MatLab functions for 
  1) Extracting sinusoidal peaks
  2) Find and plot pitch using Two-Way Mismatch error 
    (Vocal melody extraction in the presence of pitched accompaniment in polyphonic music, Vishweshwara Rao and Preeti Rao, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, Accepted January 2010))
  3) Calculate Pitch Salience (Melody Extraction from Polyphonic Music Signals using Pitch Contour Characteristics, Justin Salamon* and Emilia Gomez, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO, SPEECH, AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING)
  4) Improved version of HPCP (E. Gómez, "Tonal Description of Polyphonic Audio for Music Content Processing," INFORMS Journal on Computing, vol. 18, no. 3, pp. 294–304, 2006.)
  
  The folder also contains some test .wav sample files used to test the functions.
